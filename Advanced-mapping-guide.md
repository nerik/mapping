### Parking
**Individual parking spaces**
Draw a box enclosing the parking spaces and use the [terracer plugin](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Terracer) to create a grid. Replace the default `building=yes` tag with `amenity=parking_space`. If you created adjacent grids, you would want to use the validator to automatically merge the overlapping nodes.
