### Buildings
**Parallel buildings**
Using the [building tools plugin](), selecting a building and using the tool aligns subsequent buildings to the first one.

You can use the area extrude tool (x), to quickly add details to the outlines by creating new nodes (double click) and then dragging the faces.



### Parking
**Individual parking spaces**
Draw a box enclosing the parking spaces and use the [terracer plugin](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/Terracer) to create a grid. Replace the default `building=yes` tag with `amenity=parking_space`. If you created adjacent grids, you would want to use the validator to automatically merge the overlapping nodes.
