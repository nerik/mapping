# Saving and loading a previous JOSM session

It is possible to save a JOSM session similar most GIS software (in QGIS we call it a project file).  The JOSM session saves your current map view, OSM data and loaded layers such as imagery. 

The JOSM session is available in `File` menu.  You need to be in `Expert mode` to access this feature.  
To activate Expert mode, go to JOSM Preferences, activate `Expert mode` by clicking the checkbox.

## Saving a JOSM session

Load any of your preferred layers in JOSM.  
Save the JOSM session file clicking, `File > Session > Save session as ... `
Select any layers you want loaded when you start a new JOSM session.

NOTE: Do not save any OSM data within your `.jos` file.  Always load new data to avoid data conflicts.
