**[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org)** is an online [open data platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) to collect the world's geographic data based on the Wikipedia model of [crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).
The project started in 2004 by Steve Coast and is now governed by the non profit [OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page) based in the UK. 

The OSMF is responsible for ensuring that the project and collected map data is free and openly accessible to anyone in the world by supporting infrastructure costs through annual fundraising drives. The foundation constitutes a [democratic body](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Join) of elected members from the OSM community and has the final word in the case of disputes in the project.

### Open Geographic Data

The most important feature of the OSM project is that the map data is Open and Free:
- Anyone can alter the vector map database comprising the raw geometries and properties by creating, updating or removing objects with a free user account
- Anyone can download the entire raw map database for their own application, commercial use or research
- Anyone can view the history of changes of any map object or any other user in the system

Usage of the geodata is controlled by a license called the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License) which broadly states that:
- you do not have to pay anybody anything or ask permission to use the data
- you may use the data for personal, community, educational, commercial, government or any other use that you can think of
- you must attribute `OpenStreetMap` in your resulting project
- if you make any additions or enhancements to the data, you must release the resulting data under the same terms as above.

### The OSM community
What started as an interesting idea in 2004 with a handful of volunteers has grown to a global movement on the scale and importance of Wikipedia. In 10 years, the project has over [2 million registered users](http://www.openstreetmap.org/stats/data_stats.html) and over 20,000 active contributors every month, mapping out their neighborhoods and countries using GPS devices, field surveys and satellite imagery tracing as a hobby.

The result is a living map of the world made by the citizens of earth on a level of detail that is unparalleled in human history.

The primary documentation about the project is available on the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) while discussion takes place over the various [talk mailing lists](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo) and the [oftc #osm IRC channel](http://irc.openstreetmap.org) (try it out!).

Mappers worldwide meet each other and organize social events like [mapping parties](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties) to make it fun to explore neighborhoods and make new friends. You can organize one too, just create a page on the wiki with details and spread the word on your local mailing lists.

 Major corporate supporters of OSM from the past include [Yahoo!](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Aerial_Imagery), [MapQuest](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapQuest) and [Microsoft Bing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bing). The OSM [license terms ](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) helps to keep the data open and available for anybody to use.

OSM as a community, runs yearly international conferences called State of the Map. 2007 was the first year this conference was conducted in England. Since then the community has run 9 conferences and there has been an immense involvement by the opensource community which has led to a huge crowd gathering. One can imagine the growth of this community from around 200 attendees in the year 2014 to around 740 people from 40 different countries attending the 2015 conference held in New York City. 

##### Some more insight about State of the map -

SOTM conferences is all about the vast community coming together to share and discuss their work, various projects and also to get introduced to the vast mapping community. During the conference, you get involved in a lot of talks and few Hackday workshop's. This is a great opportunity to learn about what improvements can be  done in the future and get involved and interact with this huge community. The fact that we get an opportunity to meet and interact with few of the long time contributors of OSM itself is amazing. We at Mapbox have been helping in running this event from quite some years the main people involved being @bonniebogle  and @lxbarth. @bonniebogle has been associated since 2012 and since then, we at Mapbox are making immense efforts to support OpenStreetMap into making it as friendly and look at ways to grow the [community](https://github.com/mapbox/hey/issues/4356). 

2015 gave a great opportunity for the Bengaluru team as well. @geohacker and @planemad talk was part of the 60 sessions conducted . SOTM also provides the opportunity for scholarship where in you could get a opportunity to travel and attend the summit. [Few takeaways from SOTM NY 2015](https://github.com/mapbox/hey/issues/4317).

##### Commercial interest 

Though Mapbox uses a mix of open-source, public-domain, and proprietary sources to generate maps, it relies heavily on OSM data for many of its products. As of the present day  there are lot of companies who use OpenStreetMap via Mapbox's rendering and tools provided.
