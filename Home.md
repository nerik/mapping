## Mapping on OpenStreetMap

*This is the Mapbox team guide to OpenStreetMap. The [Mapbox data team](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox#Mapbox_Data_Team) is using this document as an introduction to mapping with OpenStreetMap. We invite you to use it too. And if you have a suggestion for an improvement - [let us know!](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/issues).*

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) is the free and editable map of the world, created and maintained by a huge international community. Anybody can create an account and start editing on OpenStreetMap.org within minutes. To learn more, read the [Introduction to the OpenStreetMap Project](Introduction to the OpenStreetMap Project)
