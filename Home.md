Welcome to the home of Mapbox's mapping activities on [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/about). [Our data team](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox) updates OpenStreetMap based on quality analysis and customer feedback. Our principle is *work in the open*. You are welcome to join [one of our open mapping projects over on the issue queue](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/issues) or use our documentation of best practices in this Wiki.

## Mapping projects

The [Mapbox data team](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox#Mapbox_Data_Team) leads and participates in initiatives to improve OpenStreetMap data. All ongoing projects are coordinated and documented [on the issue queue of this repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/issues).

We are always interested in how we can make our work better and collaborate with everyone else around this amazing project. If you have suggestions or questions, [open an issue for us](https://github.com/mapbox/mapping/issues) or [send us a message directly](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox#Mapbox_Data_Team).
