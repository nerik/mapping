## What is a mapping party?

A mapping party is an event where people come together to work on the OpenStreetMap project. OpenStreetMap is a free and open-source map that can be contributed, edited, and used by anyone. A mapping party is a chance for people who have never mapped to meet experienced mappers and learn about how to contribute and use OpenStreetMap. We'll gather in downtown Almaty with the objective of learning about and contributing to OpenStreetMap in Kazakhstan.
